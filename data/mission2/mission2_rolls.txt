Iosefka casts Otiluke's Resilient Sphere!
Meta
DC: 18
DEX Save
Effect: Enclosed (Resilient Sphere)
Effect
A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing--not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects--can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

Iosefka casts Bigby's Hand!
Iosefka
Effect: Arcane Fist [10 rounds] (Attack: Clenched Fist; Attack: Forceful Hand; Attack: Grasping Hand; Attack: Interposing Hand; Parent: Bigby's Hand)
Effect
You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the effects with it.

Iosefka casts Resilient Sphere!
Meta
DC: 18
DEX Save
Effect: Enclosed (Resilient Sphere)
Effect
A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing--not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects--can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.
Concentration
Dropped Bigby's Hand due to concentration.
Bigby Hand removed from combat.

Damage: 1d12 (10) + 8 + 2d12 (9, 4) + 2 + 0 [magical slashing] = 33
Effect
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a frost giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human.


The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can’t be shut off in these conditions.


As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.


Proficiency with a Greataxe allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

Concentration: DC 20
Effect
This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.


Slumbering (Uncommon). Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.


Stirring (Rare). The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.


Wakened (Very Rare). The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.


As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Ea...
