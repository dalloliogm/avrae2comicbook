whew that was tense
@Hari (Bobue) what did we figure was in that blackness area around the dais?
Hari (Bobue) — 7/9/2025 12:55 AM
Tar pit basically
5ft deep
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 1:17 AM

I did, but I believe being Incap with Banishment broke my held action
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 3:22 PM
I just noticed that everyone except Don Dan is 10 ft in the air 🤪
Galwen (Ari)

 — 7/9/2025 3:37 PM
I wanted to bypass the Mirror Image with blindsense so I had to be!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/9/2025 4:02 PM
10ft is ground lvl up there, isn't it?
and the reiling is 15ft high
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 6:07 PM
yeah something like dat
Don come join the cool kids
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 9:17 PM
@Hari (Bobue) just reminder Gaermok has 15ft reach in case AR3 runs 😈
Hari (Bobue) — 7/9/2025 11:16 PM
@Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) RAW that's technically a death, but im not mean so ur just knocked out haha

I have a Revivify Tattoo so if I don't have to use it, that's great lol
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 11:36 PM
don't worry, I have tricks!
first I will use my reaction to send the 26hp damage to my Abjurer's Bangle
then I'll eat the magic missiles 30hp damage to end up at 7hp
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/9/2025 11:44 PM
then 🙏
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/10/2025 6:13 AM
The abjurer's bangle uses the reaction, is that right? 
I really wanted to give Gaermok a VoA this turn.
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/10/2025 6:33 AM
@Galwen (Ari) VoA on AR3!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/10/2025 6:46 AM
@Hari (Bobue) the simulacrus tried to cross the wall, but he failed both saves. 
It should have been orange layer before green, I think I got it wrong 
Between layers, he uses adrenaline rush
He'll also use absorb elements after the orange
Galwen (Ari)

@Hari (Bobue) Galwen is using Blindsense to hopefully see through the mirror images! LMK if I should still roll despite that
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/10/2025 9:49 AM
10+10 multiclass is definately not optimal 😭  but can a poor kitty do
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/10/2025 12:30 PM
he would have loved it too 😢 The price we pay to stay conscious
but Galwen made better use of it I think
I'd need a crit to beat that
(which I'm still waiting on with a human🤤)
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/10/2025 12:37 PM
it's too bad the damage record for a single attack is 3x double the norm record range, I think both Galwen and Gaermok could have a shot on a crit
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/10/2025 10:09 PM
@Hari (Bobue) the only one left is Iosefka, the clock ticks on their turn right, not the Map turn?
we seem to have 1 tick left so we might just make this one
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 9:45 AM
@Hari (Bobue) Don't forget the simulacrus needs to get the Acid and Poison damage from crossing the wall and failing the save
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/11/2025 10:04 AM
so we should get one more round right? Flow does not have enough to down them in one turn
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 1:18 PM
yeah we're down to 1 on the clock on this turn, I oughta be able to finish the job on my turn, barring any disaster on Iosefka's turn 😂
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/11/2025 2:38 PM
At least they're bloodied
Hari (Bobue) — 7/11/2025 2:47 PM
hey sorry a lot happened yester day
back now
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 3:16 PM
Long as you're okay!
oooooooooo this got spicy
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 3:43 PM
Woah
We... just survived a Meteor Swarm
Does Gaermok have something to cancel that?
I could try to counterspell.. but then we can't say we survived a meteor swarm
Galwen (Ari)
[NDND]
 — 7/11/2025 3:49 PM
Relentless Rage
So that's a con save to stay up at 1 HP basically
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 3:50 PM
I think he also has Relentless Endurance from being an half orc
Let me try to counterspell the Time Stop - because otherwise we don't have a way to break the Resilient Sphere
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 3:51 PM
he already used his reaction but fear not, he has a million 0hp contingencies 😂
Relentless would probably tic first since it's species based
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 3:53 PM
ouch.. The counterspell worked :ablobtap:
Galwen (Ari)
[NDND]
 — 7/11/2025 3:53 PM
I don't know if you can Counterspell since it would be while we were Time Stopped
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 3:53 PM
I can counterspell the Time Stop
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 3:54 PM
I think he means the time stop itself, but she might counterspell his counter spell
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 3:54 PM
Maybe it's not a real time stop, but some other effect
@Hari (Bobue)
Hari (Bobue) — 7/11/2025 4:02 PM
It’s a real time stop, but do expect a counterspell your way
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 4:13 PM
Fair enough!
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 4:19 PM
counter wars!
I counter her counter of his counter!
Hari (Bobue) — 7/11/2025 4:27 PM
Also to clarify the rp, the ritual has been delayed by one round as she was forced to use her action to defend herself
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 4:27 PM
@Don Explodicus (sfollac) should I ready another attack if you can Dispel the sphere?
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 4:59 PM
Yes, I'm going to dispel it
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 5:00 PM
I'll hang on to my smack then, can't do much now besides go take a pot shot at the wraith then run back up
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/11/2025 6:19 PM
@Hari (Bobue) Dispel magic lv 5 on the resilient sphere
Hari (Bobue) — 7/12/2025 10:38 AM
Yup! It disapears!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/12/2025 10:51 AM
@Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) resilient sphere is gone! You can use your attack!
@Flow (Tjolanta) VoA attack on Iosefka!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/12/2025 11:15 AM
missed that you hadn't rp'd yet, I can move my post @Don Explodicus (sfollac)
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/12/2025 11:15 AM
Np! I put a Ph
Is this one of Flow's last gates?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/12/2025 11:15 AM
on phone so I'll rp later
might be the last one, I think it is
I think she's tired of getting almost killed by now 😅
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/12/2025 11:18 AM
I'm going to miss Flow, at least she got the killing blow on this one, maybe the last gate
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/12/2025 11:20 AM
I really like her ❤️ even if she is not as powerful as so many others
that sphere, was it visible for anyone?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/12/2025 12:16 PM
I just realised, only Flow did dmg to Iosefka? Did she rip them apart on her own? (unless they save themselves somehow) Or did I miss something? 
They did take dmg from sphere too, got confused by the healthy state at her turn
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/12/2025 12:25 PM
She got a bit of damage from the vitriolic sphere, but I think she had some thp at that point
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/12/2025 3:12 PM
well that didn't work very well
I'm not readying any attacks for you anymore Don 😜
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — Yesterday at 3:13 AM
@Hari (Bobue) I'll move us past Map in a bit if you can't make it back, Flow should be able to finish the fight unless something happens with Iosefka to escape death 🙂
Hari (Bobue) — Yesterday at 8:15 AM

Thanks for DMing! 
It was a clever challenge - between the prismatic wall, wall of force, darkness, and the rest. I'm going to have to review my list of prepared spells.
Flow (Tjolanta) — Yesterday at 1:38 PM
Thanks for a fun (probably last) gate !
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — Yesterday at 2:09 PM
this one was tight! I enjoyed the triple barrier challenge, it was fun to RP the big dumb giant trying to figure out the walls 😂
Hari (Bobue) — Yesterday at 3:04 PM
Glad you guys enjoyed it! I’m sorry about my slow turns towards the end there 😭
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — Yesterday at 3:24 PM
LIFE
Flow (Tjolanta) — Yesterday at 10:39 PM
sorry for the ph, will rp tomorrow
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 2:12 PM
In principle, the simulacrus may have survived the Prismatic Wall and the Meteor Swarm. It is difficult, but it had absorb elements, relentless endurance, and a contingency.
So, there is a chance that I left my simulacrus alive, trapped in the Arcane Prime. What can go wrong with that?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 2:32 PM
Flow hasn't left yet, she could urge them to follow?
Or do they want to continue with that ritual .... ? 😂
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 2:35 PM
Don't worry... I like the idea of leaving a copy of myself entrapped in a magical plane. Maybe they will become the next evil villain :adevil:
Flow (Tjolanta) — 2:36 PM
Can they be healed? Flow has tattoos she hasn't used
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 2:37 PM
Unfortunately a simulacrus cannot be healed... It's a considered a construct, or an illusion
Hari (Bobue) — 2:50 PM
