havn't needed to dash before 🙂
or disengage
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/29/2025 8:43 PM
hehe
we def need the flair though
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/29/2025 8:44 PM
yep!
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/29/2025 8:44 PM
trying to see if getting max mood will make Ghastly corporeal
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/29/2025 8:44 PM
she has -1d6 on all checks but maybe I should
or not ?
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/29/2025 8:44 PM
doooo eeeet
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/29/2025 8:45 PM
then I need to think, it is so exhausting 😆
what are the current rules, will a failure be -1?
no, they don't! Ill try!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/29/2025 9:17 PM
that ... was not that easy, and a little bit of a stretch, but it sort of works 🙃
and sorry Gaermok but you where all I could find to hide behind 😅
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/29/2025 9:45 PM
I'm pretty sure that's not gonna be the last time someone needs him for that 🤣
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 12:43 AM
Nice job… can’t believe you pulled that off with a -5 to the check
And Galwen with the triple success!!!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 6:54 AM
Hey all! Sorry for the delay… will have to take Ghastly’s turn in the AM
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 3:53 PM
1 more flair check success and you will put the Crowd at +2 next round… Bless for you and Bane on Ghastly!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/30/2025 3:56 PM
@Rhys (Ban) just one more!
Rhys (Ban) — 5/30/2025 3:57 PM
Assuming Rhys is still up he'll go for religion again and since Ghastly is immune to bps he'll use both action and BA if needed
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 4:07 PM
If you use your action you get advantage on the check!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 5/30/2025 4:19 PM
I'm proud of Gaermok  for passing that INT save
(and really grateful to Flow for the potion - it was just enough healing point to survive!)
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 5:49 PM
I let Don take a turn??

What have I done 😅
Rhys (Ban) — 5/30/2025 5:54 PM
Passed the flair check!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 5:55 PM
Oh snap
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/30/2025 6:53 PM
I think it's more of a case of him being too stupid to know he'd failed 🤣
finally failed a constitution save to stay conscious, however I have one more trick up my sleeve!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 5/30/2025 6:58 PM
Hydra charms are quite good, I may get one or two myself
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/30/2025 6:59 PM
if only I had the slot for another, though I could definitely give up my bracers unless they become very useful down the line
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/30/2025 7:25 PM
@Rhys (Ban) clutch flair! now let's see if the theory holds up...
Galwen (Ari)

 — 5/30/2025 7:26 PM
I believe Grimald should have advantage against charm since he's an elf
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 8:52 PM
Oh you’re right! 

@Grimald (gophren) you actually made your saving throw vs Charmed thanks to your elven heritage (and @Galwen (Ari) ‘s keen eye)!

(Ari, please take a DMI for that catch.) ❤️ 
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/30/2025 11:14 PM
I am getting Mojoverse vibes bigtime
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/30/2025 11:17 PM
Ghastly = Mojo confirmed
@Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) Looks like your theory was correct...

There was also another way to make Ghastly corporeal which you might discover later.
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/30/2025 11:20 PM
I had statistics on my side, in a scenario where action is nonstop, the secret wouldn't realistically be in a form that wasn't part of the action
and the only thing we hadn't touched upon yet was a positive mood bonus 😉
I mean it was that, or taunting the crud out of him with yo momma jokes...
"Yo Momma is so corporeal...."
Grimald (gophren) — 5/31/2025 3:15 AM
@Kayliana (Ryan) is Grimald still affected by the frightened effect and the rot ray?
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 3:16 AM
Gaermok got the rot ray recently so maybe not that
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 4:10 AM
Nope!  Those already ended.  I removed them from your status
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 4:16 AM
awkward, I totally forgot to move on the map last turn 😞
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 4:34 AM
@Grimald (gophren) I'll wait for your IC to do mine 🙂
@Don Explodicus (sfollac) it's up to you!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 5:34 AM
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 5:56 AM
Ghastly uses Legendary Action: Villain's Dying Monologue
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 5/31/2025 7:03 AM
It's done! 
Unless Ghastly has other villain tricks up his sleeve 
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 7:12 AM
That’s it!! I will get this wrapped up tomorrow. 

Great job everyone on a well-earned victory.
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/31/2025 9:23 AM
Does that mean that charm and muddled mind drops from Flow also?
great combo of effects ... 😭
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 1:41 PM
Yes! All ended when Ghastly dies
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 1:55 PM
"dies"
we've all heard THAT one before ...
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 2:56 PM

@Hourglass Gate
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 3:45 PM
that was some narrow victory right there!
poor Ghastly, he never knew any better, probably had a troubled tadpolehood 😞
Grimald (gophren) — 5/31/2025 4:11 PM
Tough gate for Grimald, but some  really interesting mechanics! Thank you Ryan
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/31/2025 4:13 PM
So fun (and oh so annoying 😭)
low on mental saves are starting to be an issue
I liked the flair stuff though!
Described to to one of our gm's, and he seemed to like it a lot
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 4:21 PM
Yeah Flow needs Resilient: WIS or something badly! 😅 glad you enjoyed it
Thanks to everyone for helping me adjust the Crowd Mood mechanic on the fly! It was meant to be a fun risk-reward thing and opportunity for fun RP and you all definitely improved it. 

Btw the other way to make Ghastly corporeal would have been to deal at least 25 damage to him from another damage type, which would have forced him to make a CON save (like concentration) or become corporeal until the start of his next turn. 👍
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/31/2025 4:26 PM
one more final choice to do for Flow, maybe res wis is it? Though it sounds a little bit boring 
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 4:42 PM
It is a bit boring but you know what’s more boring? Being charmed/paralyzed/stunned whatever for a whole gate because you fail most of your WIS saves
🤪
Flow (Tjolanta) — 5/31/2025 4:43 PM
You don't have to tell me that
🤣
though thats just wis then, there are cha and int as well...
but, just one more gate perhaps, so need to use all the coins and level up one last time
and the +1 on wis is for nothing, prof is not bad thoguh
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 5:46 PM
Hydra Charm all the way
thank you for the awesome gate @Kayliana (Ryan) ! I think you win this round, I'll have to examine Kay's sheet for the best way to trigger lots of healing next time 🤔
Kayliana (Ryan) — 5/31/2025 6:04 PM
Some kind of low level AOE on the raptors (~10HP) and lots of damage on 6 PCs so I can get big Mass cure wounds heal
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 5/31/2025 6:09 PM
Thanks for DMing, it was a great gate! 
I liked the extra mechanics, it made things more interesting. I also liked that the combat was in three waves, as it forced us to save resources. 
The first wave would have been very nasty, with those undead creatures that inflicted acid when damaged.
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 6:47 PM
Malkeen's needs to start selling a "Pocket Don"
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 5/31/2025 10:11 PM
@Don Explodicus (sfollac) had to name drop you on my IC, hope there's no fees involved
Kayliana (Ryan) — 6/1/2025 5:27 AM
You’re welcome! And thank YOU for such an epic meteor swarm! I LOLd hard when I read that
Chefs kiss

PMS is hitting me like a truck, I'll hopefully exit before the weekend is over
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 6/1/2025 1:27 PM
hey you're synchronized with my wife 😅
Rhys (Ban) — 6/2/2025 4:21 PM
Sorry, had a busy weekend. Thanks for the fun gate! The gate mechanics mixed things up and kept us on our toes for sure!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 6/3/2025 2:16 AM
Congrats on the level up!! Hope you are feeling better… ❤️
@Flow (Tjolanta) congrats on hitting level 20!!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 6/3/2025 8:13 AM
Just too bad I missed getting into queue, got stuck shopping 😄
