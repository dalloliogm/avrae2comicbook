Flow
Name: Flowing Wind of Lush Mountains (Flow)
Race (and subrace): Tabaxi
Background: Urchin Stray
Class: Swashbuckler Rogue/Battle Master Fighter

Description:
Flow is a tabaxi with a golden spotted fur. Her clothes are clean but simple; A plain blouse and a pair of pants outfitted with practical leg pockets. The armour however, look’s a bit more expensive. Noticeably high craftsmanship, well fitted and made for mobility and stealth. Her well kept rapiers follow the same pattern.

She left her home on the other side of the great sea a long time ago, at a young age, and before finding her way to the Gates she has had a rather varied life. Her first safe haven was in a rather questionable association. There she thrived, until that situation went out of hand and she decided it was best for her to leave.

She then stayed at a smaller travelling circus until she felt it was best for all involved that she they parted ways. This is when she started to earn money as an adventurer. Staying longer than she ever thought she would in a small town with an unusual amount of various problems. Her restlessness finally had her leave again, and she allowed herself to be enrolled into the armed forces of a local lord, which granted her useful battle training. This was where she heard stories about the Gates. Triggering her curiosity she left to find someone who knew how to get there.

Galwen
Name: Galwen Mannadil
Race (and subrace): Pallid Elf
Background: Custom Courtier
Class: Rogue
Subclass: Inquisitive

Description: Galwen Mannadil was 23rd in line to the Duchy of Aistaquen. Not only was she far down the line of succession, she wasn't even talented enough in their eyes. With only the barest of knowledge in their ancestral magic, she was not one that was paid attention to.

And so she focused more on things she could do without magic. Her skills, her senses, her aim. Archery. With so little attention on her, no one batted an eye when a recruiter came to their lands and asked for help Defending the Gates. And so Galwen Mannadil vowed to do so, even if it meant spilling her noble blood. The Gates were more than worth it.

Don Explodicus
Name: Don Explodicus
Race (and subrace): Orc
Background: Far Traveler
Class: Wizard/Cleric
Subclass: Evocation/Order

Description:Explodicus is a jovial and loud orc, who likes to drink beer and blast things on the battlefield. Trained in the arts of wizardry and ordained as a cleric of Karaash, he has been sent to represent the Chiefdoms of the Roaring Lion in the defence of the Gates.

In battle he believes that the best way to motivate a bunch of uneducated and barbaric Orcs is to throw fireballs and thunder at them, and tell them that only those who have faith will be left unarmed. Sometimes one or two Orcs get accidentally incinerated, but the ones that survive find the experience very entertaining.

In terms of physical appearance, Explodicus is much weaker of the average orc, due to a deformation of his right arm that makes him unable to wield effectively most weapons. He can barely carry his Scale Mail, and at 5'6" he is short for his kind. In fact, his mission to The Gate is most likely a way to get away from some powerful enemies, as most Orc chiefs do not tolerate well Orcs that lead with smarts instead of strength.
