Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 8:07 AM
Ahh, Spelldriver is just missing in your list of feats, easy to miss
Found it in dndbeyond though, I peeked 🙂
Grimald (gophren) — 4/14/2025 8:19 AM
I think I asked you the same thing last gate too :blobsad:  I'm getting old
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 8:30 AM
Sometimes it is good to look up for each other even if we might have forgotten some feat ... nobody complained when I used steady aim and then ran a crazy distance, the same turn, had to sleep to suddenly realize what I had done 😭
Grimald (gophren) — 4/14/2025 8:33 AM
oh I saw that, but was also too tired to write
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 8:35 AM
good thing I had a maneuver to cover it without to much mess 🙈 
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 1:29 PM
and now she's crippled by fear instead so still have to manage that dis 😂
Galwen (Ari) — 4/14/2025 1:34 PM
Shouldn't Don only heal 10 hp, not 25? ⁠hourglass-dice⁠
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 2:55 PM
In that case our combined hp is about the same as the damage in your last arrow, which was A LOT, but not much divided on four ... 😅
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/14/2025 2:56 PM
It's fixed in the line below
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 2:57 PM
It is! And our combined hp is as much as 69 !
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 3:25 PM
Following avrae is a skill 😆
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/14/2025 7:58 PM
Having lots of HP is so overrated
All you need is 1️⃣
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/14/2025 8:03 PM
If Flow survives that long she'll need someone to throw her at Higara or something 😅 or she'll have to go ranged 
She cannot even get to the other priest ...
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/14/2025 8:07 PM
Yeah Frightened condition can really suck if you are mainly melee
Grimald (gophren) — 4/14/2025 8:11 PM
aaaaaaaa
@ryan, I'm sorry, I just realized I have disadv on attacks since I don't have a swimming speed, nor a piercing weapon
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/14/2025 8:11 PM
Oooo Grimald talking some shizzzz
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/14/2025 8:12 PM
Yeah I was about to ping you for that 😅
Grimald (gophren) — 4/14/2025 8:13 PM
I think 2 out of 3 still hit
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 4:37 AM
@Flow (Tjolanta) turn reminder!
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 8:07 AM
Can swashbucklers add Sneak Attack when they have disadvantage on the roll?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 8:07 AM
Steady aim fixes that
now she WILL stand still 😄
never know when avrae will impose the dis or not or how to force into normal
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 8:14 AM
rogue thing, but not swash specifically, though the swash is why she gets sneak on her own
wis saves is always her downfall
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 8:19 AM
Usually, you can see on your initiative status Attack, Disadvantage...
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 8:20 AM
someone said you could always use both dis and adv and thereby get neutral regardless of what avrae say
never dared to try 🙂
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 8:20 AM
Yeah
That's what I do
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 8:22 AM
now each time I leave my turn with the feeling that was her last 😂 😭
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 11:20 AM
don't worry! 
unless she also called Higara a bloated jellyfish, I think Flow is safe :derp:
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 12:11 PM
If she does that thing again, where she breathed psychic energy and the priest redirect the damage to us, we are fried 😅
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:06 PM
Hey what a great idea!!!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:08 PM
Wis save are kinda important. Especially at high ranks. 

Can you still get Resilient WIS?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:11 PM
don't think so
well, she could take ASI as last level
rogue 10
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 1:14 PM
calm emotions as a spell tattoo?
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:15 PM
she was initially on another server, more quests and such there, and when I moved her here I did change from her inital wis-dump which put her in some rather fun but anoying situations 😄
she was never really optimized, just a restless stray cat who doesn't really care, or care a great deal
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:17 PM
hmm, would that help?
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 1:17 PM
uses an action to remove either charm or frightened
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:17 PM
ohh, interesting
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 1:18 PM
Technically, suppresses
So if you lose concentration, the fear/charm comes back
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 1:19 PM
there is also an armor, but requires attunement
https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#gloomwrought%20studded%20leather%20armor_bmt
Items - 5etools
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:19 PM
@Hourglass Gate 

So… that happened…

At this point, how do you all feel about reinforcements/strike team/gatekeeper aid?
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 1:20 PM
Also, I'm not panicking yet because I'm pretty sure Don still has Relentless Endurance
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 1:20 PM
so wait until top of the round?
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 1:21 PM
Happy to wait
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:21 PM
I think Flows opinion of water is going to change, if she survives this
I cannot see how we can manage this, but I'm ok with waiting
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:22 PM
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 1:22 PM
a cat that does not like water, how unsual
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 1:23 PM
Also, I just checked, he also has Contingency
I believe in the power of Defenders :WCatStrong:
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 1:25 PM
some cats love water, like tigers and lynxes
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:42 PM
Unless @Don Explodicus (sfollac) can also make the save, that howl ends concentration on any spells so the summoned dragon would disappear.
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 1:51 PM
Oh that’s true
But concentration on dragon still drops
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 1:54 PM
Why does the concentration drop? I think I passed the save
I have relentless endurance, before using contingency
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 2:19 PM
Oh you did pass the save! Never mind, dragon stays!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 2:19 PM
Cool!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 2:19 PM
Sorry didn’t see that initially
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 2:23 PM
Np... I'm worried about Flow, though. That's too far for me to help
@Kayliana (Ryan) Higara can make an AoO on the gem dragon
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 2:59 PM
Done. He will grapple it and prevent it from moving
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 3:34 PM
Ok. At least she used her reaction so Galwen can move away if she wants
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 3:43 PM
Galwen is still grappled sadly
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 4:08 PM
Damn... I was hoping she could finish 4pri before its turn
Grimald (gophren) — 4/15/2025 4:24 PM
steady aim should do it
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/15/2025 4:35 PM
sorry for being so far away, she could not go closer
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/15/2025 10:23 PM
No problem. I have a plan to teleport and heal you on my next turn
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 10:37 PM
Ah, heck. Flow isn't conscious so that wouldn't proc sneak attack
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 10:47 PM
I need to wake up more to think about what I should do lol
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 11:07 PM
My current options are
Steady Aim and Hasted Action attack 4Priest, hoping that my base damage is enough to kill it, Greater Healing Potion myself
set up Insightful Fighting against Higara and attack with a mundane dagger (maybe they're resistant and not immune, hopefully), potion myself
or just go all out and Hasted Action 4Priest and action attack Higara lmao
Don't mind me, I'm just considering my options now that they're written out
Considerations include the fact that Higara has me grappled, and averages 30+ damage on a hit. With a Greater Healing Potion and Uncanny Dodge, I can probably stay conscious so that Don can focus on Flow
Galwen (Ari) — 4/15/2025 11:19 PM
Alternatively, I can attempt to escape and heal Flow myself, but given the DC is 18 and my Str mod is +0, this is unlikely lol
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/15/2025 11:22 PM
Nice job.
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 6:32 AM
Okay, top of the round
What do?
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 6:36 AM
But can Don stay conscious?
Galwen (Ari) — 4/16/2025 8:11 AM
At the start of Don's turn, if he's at 0, he'll be healed with Contingency, plus he also has shield/silvery barbs I think he'll be fine for the time being 🤔
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/16/2025 9:17 AM
I don't know if we dare to go on, but I'm fine with either, whatever you decide
Though there are lots of turns left before we'd be able to get Higara down, and Flow will have to change to bow if she gets a turn, and I do not know if she can use her bow prone. If she stands up she will not be able to get sneak attack
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/16/2025 9:24 AM
She's also out of range ... but since dis doesn't stack steady aim would still overcome that I think
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 9:24 AM
you can attack while prone, but with disadv
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/16/2025 9:25 AM
so with steady aim she has three dis and one adv with steady aim, which still makes it end up normal?
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 9:31 AM
yep
Galwen (Ari) — 4/16/2025 9:33 AM
Yeah lol
Galwen is technically prone right now
Since she was knocked out but just never moved from then
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 9:39 AM
I will have Grimald go to their eyes and make himself a target 😛
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/16/2025 10:35 AM
We're still moving on right?
on foot so will fix ph later
Galwen (Ari) — 4/16/2025 10:39 AM
Grimald casually doubling his HP on his turn
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 10:40 AM
plus the resistance
Grimald (gophren) — 4/16/2025 10:41 AM
One more round I guess
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/16/2025 11:45 AM
I can teleport Flow with Vortex Warp, then heal her with healing word. Would you like to be teleported near Higara, or distant? 
Galwen (Ari) — 4/16/2025 3:53 PM
Well. Now I know my dagger will be useless!
Galwen (Ari) — 4/16/2025 4:09 PM
😎 it was a good idea to drink that tiny little potion just now
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/16/2025 4:14 PM
Lol it really was
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/16/2025 5:32 PM
Near was perfect, even if it turned out not so perfect 😅 that is what I'd suggested if I had responded in time
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/16/2025 9:52 PM
I was thinking about Polymorphing someone into a Titanoboa or something like that. But then, Higara is immune to mundane damage. 
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/17/2025 12:20 AM
You guys are gonna be FINE. You have, like… 27 HIT POINTS among the 4 of you! 

of course, 20 of those are Grimald’s 
Grimald (gophren) — 4/17/2025 2:59 AM
Top of the round guys, what is the plan
We are heavily penalized by not having Flow attacking
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/17/2025 3:47 AM
@Hourglass Gate ping to see gophren’s post
Grimald (gophren) — 4/17/2025 4:01 AM
I still have 2 blessings, 1 tattoo charge
Galwen (Ari) — 4/17/2025 4:09 AM
With our health being as bad as it is, and no reliable way to keep it up, maaaaaybe we can scrape by with Gatekeeper Aid?

I'm personally fine going without it still
Grimald (gophren) — 4/17/2025 4:16 AM
If anyone wishes the Gatekeeper Aid, I will support that.
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/17/2025 4:46 AM
I wouldn't mind some hp, and Gatekeeper aid seems to be the best (only?) chance to get back in for Flow
Grimald (gophren) — 4/17/2025 6:26 AM
Then I also vote for aid!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/17/2025 7:05 AM
I agree we need the aid, especially if she does that thing of reflecting damage again
Grimald (gophren) — 4/17/2025 12:51 PM
Alright, I think we all agree to go for aid, so I'll do my turn with the assumption that we receive that
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/17/2025 12:58 PM
I think I now paus waiting for @Kayliana (Ryan)
I don't know if something puts Flow back to unconscious again, I've seen a trend 😅
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/17/2025 1:27 PM
@Hourglass Gate 

Gatekeeper Aid has been requested! I will have Gibbulous send the healing before we continue.
Ok @Flow (Tjolanta) you are good to go 🙂
I will RP the gatekeeper aid a bit later
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/17/2025 1:37 PM
Currently working but will take care of my turn ( I have a TURN!!!) as soon as possible
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/17/2025 1:57 PM
Wait, I let Flow have a turn?? 

What have I done…
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/17/2025 2:02 PM
The amount of hp Grimald has already beaten out of that thing and it is still "Injured" (!!!!) I cannot see how Flow can do that much impact but at least it will be something
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/18/2025 12:22 AM
sorry for late bad rolls
Galwen (Ari) — 4/18/2025 4:11 AM
The heck is that Fling roll lmfao
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/18/2025 4:12 AM
Yeah Avrae had it out for you
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 3:13 PM
why is the damage 0, isnt it magical from a +2 shortbow?
why are there a non magical shortbow, she does not have any
Grimald (gophren) — 4/19/2025 4:10 PM
@Kayliana (Ryan) I believe Galwen is dodging
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:11 PM
Ok let me check with dis
Galwen (Ari) — 4/19/2025 4:11 PM
I'm also prone lol
I got flung a couple of turns ago
But I'd like to silvery barbs that attack on Grimald, and give him the adv
Grimald (gophren) — 4/19/2025 4:12 PM
I'm too far away to do anything
Galwen (Ari) — 4/19/2025 4:12 PM
Oh right range....
I'm too far from Higara to do that
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:13 PM
Ok still hits Galwen with disadvantage. Weird, Avrae rolled a 20 for the first attack on Galwen but didn’t register it as a crit. So, I guess same damage applies
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:13 PM
Yes it should be magical piercing! Do you have a +2 Shortbow?
Grimald (gophren) — 4/19/2025 4:13 PM
she has that armor, right? that denies crits
Galwen (Ari) — 4/19/2025 4:14 PM
Mizzium armor yet
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:14 PM
Ohhh that’s it
Nice
Galwen (Ari) — 4/19/2025 4:14 PM
*yep
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 4:14 PM
I feel totaly useless this gate :blobsad:  😭
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:15 PM
You can just add the snippet magical after your attack command to make sure it applies the correct damage. But strange that it is not doing it automatically 
Grimald (gophren) — 4/19/2025 4:16 PM
it picks another weapon, a regular bow
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:16 PM
:Ghost_Hug:
Galwen (Ari) — 4/19/2025 4:17 PM
I'll bring it up now lmao, how are we feeling about Strike Team? Because we really need healing lol @Hourglass Gate
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 4:23 PM
Whatever you want to do is fine! Just letting you know that Higara is looking VERY bloodied and might seem a bit desperate with that last move.
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 4:25 PM
Yes, I notices there is a regular shortbo listed in actions, which is strange since she does not own one
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 4:33 PM
It is looking bad, I agree
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4/19/2025 5:52 PM
@Hourglass Gate OK Strike Team has been brought up… please vote as a group and let me know what you want to do!

1️⃣: Bring in the Strike Team!
2️⃣: Keep going! We got this! 
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/19/2025 8:53 PM
Wow. I don't think we are too far from beating her. But this last attack really beat us
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 8:58 PM
Idk how to get enough dmg before their next turn, or actions, with two down
Flow only have her bow now, and at dis 
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/19/2025 9:02 PM
Am I in range to silvery barbs any of those attacks?
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4/19/2025 9:04 PM
If you apply the +2 damage from the bow, it should do a bit more of damage
On the next turn, I would heal Galwen, then conjure another arcane hand or magic missile
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 9:32 PM
Ohh, I can silvery barbs too
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 9:33 PM
I missed that, thanks!
Flow (Tjolanta) — 4/19/2025 10:37 PM
Just fixed the missed +2 dmg
Though I thing Higara is out side range for silvery barbs
Kayliana (Ryan) — Yesterday at 12:43 AM
Y’all need to invest in some Distant Mind Crystals 😅
Galwen (Ari) — Yesterday at 12:56 AM
Has Sharpshooter with a 600ft range, what is distant? 🤣
Kayliana (Ryan) — Yesterday at 1:07 AM
Someday I should use a battle map where something like that would actually come into play.
@Grimald (gophren) @Flow (Tjolanta) @Don Explodicus (sfollac) what do you think?
Kayliana (Ryan) — Yesterday at 3:46 AM
(About using Strike Team, not the big battle map) 🙂
Grimald (gophren) — Yesterday at 5:31 AM
Grimald probably can resist another round, but what good would that be
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — Yesterday at 7:36 AM
I'm conflicted... I think we are close, but the next round will be difficult without help
Galwen (Ari) — Yesterday at 7:38 AM
I'm 99% sure that Strike Team must be a unanimous decision
Since you're the one with the healing abilities, you can absolutely tip the scales of voting however you want
Kayliana (Ryan) — Yesterday at 12:10 PM
@Hourglass Gate OK Strike Team has been requested! We will get that going shortly.
Kayliana (Ryan) — Yesterday at 11:15 PM
Garlic and Aeslyn are on the way!
Galwen (Ari) — Yesterday at 11:18 PM
Are we getting the Noodle man again 👀
Kayliana (Ryan) — 12:13 AM
One can only wish
Jimothy (Garlic) — 12:42 AM
Image
Jimothy (Garlic) — 12:44 AM
Alright, can you give us some IC intro and a starting spot on the map? 🙂
Kayliana (Ryan) — 1:15 AM
Sure thing!
Kayliana (Ryan) — 1:24 AM
There you go!
@Jimothy (Garlic) and @Cameron (Aeslyn) you each have a cap of water breathing if you need it. Just takes an action to put on and activate once you are underwater, and then you can speak/breathe normally. Check the pinned messages for other notes on the gate and underwater combat.
Cameron (Aeslyn) — 2:21 AM
Garlic I just did that as the easiest way to remove us from the queue
Kayliana (Ryan) — 2:32 AM
Add yourselves to init and start anywhere in the white square and we will keep going!
Jimothy (Garlic) — 4:01 AM
Can the cap be a pre-action?
If so, I'll do that. If not, I'll Crown of Stars 🫡
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4:11 AM
No, it has to be activated in the water as an action.
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4:13 AM
Or, you can just hold your breath… 🤐
Jimothy (Garlic) — 4:46 AM
One of my characters? Hold breath? Not familiar with the concept.
Kayliana (Ryan) — 4:02 PM
Ok @Don Explodicus (sfollac) feel free to continue now that we have our strike team in play!
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 4:59 PM
ok
@Galwen (Ari) Finish her off!
technically, you would have a Voice of Authority attack on my turn, when I heal you. But you would be prone and may have dropped the longbow when you fell unconscious
