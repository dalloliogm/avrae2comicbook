If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

Flow activates their Boots of Haste!
While you wear these boots, you can click your heels together to cast the haste spell on yourself as a bonus action. You don’t suffer from lethargy when the spell ends when cast using these boots. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until next dawn.
Flow
Effect: Hasted [1.1 minutes] (AC Bonus: 2; Save Advantage: Dexterity)
Effect
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

Flow (Tjolanta)
Flow needs a drink!
One for you, two for me. Drink a potion!
Valid Arguments
-t [target] - !potion now supports administering a potion or oil to a combatant during !init combat.

adv/dis - For potions that have saving throws, if needed.

-b [#] - For if you have a bonus to healing for some reason that would apply to a potion.

max - For if you would heal the maximum amount from a potion.

explode - For if you want your healing dice to explode for some reason.
Supported Potions:
Animal Friendship, Clairvoyance, Climbing, Diminution, Fire Breath, Flying, Gaseous Form, Hill Giant Strength, Frost Giant Strength, Stone Giant Strength, Fire Giant Strength, Cloud Giant Strength, Storm Giant Strength, Growth, Healing, Greater Healing, Superior Healing, Supreme Healing, Heroism, Invisibility, Invulnerability, Longevity, Mind Reading, Poison, Acid Resistance, Cold Resistance, Fire Resistance, Force Resistance, Lightning Resistance, Necrotic Resistance, Poison Resistance, Psychic Resistance, Radiant Resistance, Thunder Resistance, Speed, Vitality, Water Breathing, Etherealness, Sharpness, Slipperiness, Keoghtom's Ointment
Brew Your Own!
See !potion homebrew for instructions on including your own potions.
Known Issues:
• The way that the Giant Strength potions work is jank. They will sort of work by determining the difference between your strength score and the score granted by the potion and then giving you a -b and -d effect. And there is currently no way to grab a combatant's strength score, so these potions will have no effect beyond adding a reminded effect to anyone you administer the potion to.
• !potion has no integration with !bag. I might add this at a later date, but the full rewrite into drac2 was enough for now.

The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can’t be shut off in these conditions.


As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.


Proficiency with a Greataxe allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

Effect
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Effect
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
