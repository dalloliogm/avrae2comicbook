Each defender, wherever they are, is suddenly greeted by the apparition of a Hollyphant appearing out of thin air before promptly disappearing once she has delivered her message.

"Dear defender. You have been summoned to Occult Gate. Report immediately for deployment." 

A set of extravagant double red doors that stand in their lonesome in the distant reaches of Arcane Prime, this is the Occult gate.

Those that have defended this gate before are already struck by the difference of this visit. The Usually vibrant, aristocratic colours of the Occult gate are muted and washed out. Only the defender herself and Solange, the hollyphant that delivers her messages, still gleam as golden as ever, looking completely out of place.

"Good. You've all arrived. Welcome to the Occult gate, new and old. I am Erdegral Versprechredi, Gatekeeper of the Occult Gate." She nods respectfully.

"To safeguard and defend against occult forces effectively, one must carry an intimate knowledge of them. However, with knowledge comes power, and power easily corrupts even the most stalwart of wills. I'm afraid that my successor was one such will, and has succumbed to the burden she was tasked with. Suffice to say, the danger unfortunatly comes from within this time. She and various others have travelled to the heart of the gate to seek understanding that was never meant for mortals. Stop them, before it's too late."

Erdegral plucks a string on her Lyre, conjuring a pillar of golden and black sand within the hallway, stepping aside so they may venture forth.

Their vision is temporarily blinded by black and gold as they are teleported to their destination.

The sands subside and the defenders find themselves standing in a wide, spacious stone corridor before raised steps that are covered in thick webs. Shadowy silhouettes dot the floor leading up the stairway ominously. It seems you are not the first defenders to be sent here.

Right ahead is a shining wall glowing with all colours of the spectrum that stretches right to the top of the ceiling forebodingly. Rhythmic chanting echoes from beyond it.

Don Explodicus, the orc wizard, receives the summons and quickly makes way to the Gate. "Occult Gate, in the Arcane Prime - this is a new one for me. I hope there it will be time to study this place, after the battle."

The orc and his Simulacrus appear in front of Gatekeeper Erdegral. The real wizard can be recognized by the armour and magical items he is wearing. The simulacrus, unable to use magical items, is much less equipped - wearing simpler armour and holding a simple shield.

"Your successor was corrupted, you say? Knowledge is a dangerous thing, I understand the struggle. May Gruumsh protect us in this battle, today." says Don Explodicus.

Flow just stands there for a little while. Staring out into the air where there just where a holliphant with a note. Eyes barely open as she ponders this new task. Then she spins around and sprints to her room. Filling her pockets with flasks and grabs her gear.

Well by the gate she sits down. Listening to the gatekeeper about the task they've been assigned, all while picking out one of the flasks and reading the label. With a frown she then opens it and continues to carefully cover her whole body with the content. It takes a while, but she does not let anybody make her hurry up. Finally done she stands up, Frowning. Instinctively twitching her feet a little, as if they where dirty. Which she must admit is the honest truth, but the merchant said this would work like a charm, and she had decided to give it a try.

She quint at the orc twins and nods. "Yeah, what they said." and follows after them.

Gaermok asks around a few times before he finds his way to Occult Gate. He looks around as he arrives, one hand at the bag on his belt. He sees familiar faces and waves as he pulls a potion from his belt.

"Hullo. Time for more defending?"

He downs the familiar potion and places the bag on the ground. Once again reaching inside, he draws out his massive greataxe and rests it against a wall. The bag goes back to his belt and he leans against the axe as he listens.

He hefts his axe over his shoulder as he follows the others through the column of sand. On the other side, he expects an arena of enemies, but perhaps these gates aren't all the same.

She hacks and coughs and immediately takes off in the air, away from the gas.

She looks around, annoyed.

The air elemental remains frozen, converted into a block of ice from the cone of cold. The two orc wizard survived the blast, though, and they set to reply. 

The simulacrus is the first to move. He dashes away from the smelly cloud, and conjures a protective prayer on the others.

Then, it is the turn of the original wizard. Don explodicus dashes away from the cloud, teleports to a safer position, then conjures a massive blast of energy upon the other spellcasters. When the light is gone, two of the enemies lie down dead, while the others have become visible again, and they are blinded by the spell.

The multicoloured barrier emits a sound akin to an underwater implosion. Indigo essence seeps off it, dispersing and leaving the mixture of other colours. It is then anyone with knowledge of Arcana realise this is a Prismatic Wall, and the wizards accidentally broke one of the layers.

Gaermok watches the flash of light melt the wizard in front of him. He shrugs. Turning around to stalk back into the middle of the battlefield, he crunches a potion bottle in his mouth and looks around, spotting more wizards; but they're all spread out.

"Want to get all..." he mumbles to himself, "but all are too---ohhhh. Idea."

He clangs his bracers together and suddenly disappears in a crackle of electricity. He reappears next to one of the wizards on the western side of the battlefield.

"Hullo."

Smashing his axe down, the wizard crumples to the ground. Then he looks north, disappearing again and reappearing next to the second wizard.

"Hullo."

He cleaves the wizard in half with a particularly vicious blow; humans should know better than to mess with giants. The last wizard is on the other side of the battlefield, but Gaermok is already there with his last teleportation from the bracers.

"Hullo."

He swings his axe at the final wizard, knocking it into the ground and settling his movement amidst another crackle of electricity. Then he stalks back into the middle and looks around for more enemies. Hopefully humans. His greataxe is asking for more humans.

The Orcs have read aboutbthe Prismatic Wall spell, but have never seen one in action. The spell is the pinnacle of the abjuration school of magic - a school that is often considered the opposite of Evocation. With a mix of admiration and pragmaticism, they consider the next move. 

"We can destroy most of the layers" says the simulacrus, as he conjures an explosive cone of cold, over enemies and wall. 

"All except the Orange and the Green ones." continues the original Explodicus, as he conjures a Draconic spirit to distract one of the creatures.

"What are these things? Not sure I can take much more... " Picks out a potion and gulps the content while her eyes fall on that strange wall for a second.   "... and what's up with that?" 

Feeling some strength restored she throws the empty bottle away, frowns dismissively, and takes off towards the last annoyance. Taking a deep breath and slowly breathing out to not inhale the cloudy air. Not wanting any more hugs she lunge at them before retracting to some safe distance. Less hugs, hopefully, and less smell.

Then, the wizard takes matters in his own hands, a recites a powerful disenchantment spell, with the right words, the right tones, the right movements to disable the violet section of the wall.

Finally, the two wizards look at each other, and begin the slytherin manoeuvre, which Don learned during his school years. The simulacrus casts a spell on his original self, and Don's body begins to become much taller, much longer, and much, much bigger. Soon enough, the wizard is transformed into a gigantic snake, almost taller than the wall, and with a deformed Don face.

The other defenders may be surprised to see a Gargantuan Snake emerging from the Prismatic Wall behind them. The snake is too slow to avoid the effect of the three remaining layers, and is injured by a shower of acid, poison and force damage; yet, that doesn't seem to bother them too much.

On a second sight, the defenders may notice that the Snake has a familiar face - it's a gargantuan Don Titanoboa!

The wizard, in this state, is too stupid to do anything else than attacking the first thing they see, but they still maintain the original personality, and they smile benevolently to Flow, Galwen and Gaermoth.


On the other side of the wall, the simulacrus is left alone. He tries to pull down one of the layers of the wall, with a barrage of magic missiles, but that's not enough.

Flow (Tjolanta) — 7/1/2025 9:22 AM
Flow grunts for every missile hitting her already beaten body, but she still manages to dodge away from the Night creatures attacks. Unsure where that energy comes from, and for how long it would last, she gathers all strength she can muster and lunge at them, finally managing to put them down. Slightly revitalized she sprints off to hit her friends assailant, though leaving them still still standing as she herself stops a few paces away.

The room suddenly shudders and a deep uneasy rumbling pulsates through the stone. Shadowy writings, whispers, symbols and threads rush towards the altar at an ever increasing pace. The colour in the room begins to drain, just like the entrance to the Occult Gate.
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/2/2025 12:51 AM
Gaermok brings his axe down on the skeleton for the final blow. He hears Dan shouting from behind, something about getting ready for a short trip. He doesn't see any more enemies, so he has no choice but to trust his fellow orc. He calms himself down, clenches his axe and starts to shrink back down to normal size.

And he waits.

Edergral watches from her scrying chambers, a pit of worry slowly growing from within.

“A little nudge in the right direction goes a long way…” She mutters.

Erdegral grasps onto her authority of the gate, suppressing the banishment spell.

“Defenders. Know that you are not alone.”
Her voice echoes throughout the chamber.

From the other side of the wall, Dan has no knowledge of what happened to the defenders. He continues with the agreed plan, dropping concentration on the polymorph spell, hoping this will not inconvenience Don. Then, he continues dismantling the prismatic wall, throwing more magic missiles at it. 

In a matter of seconds, Don goes through a transformation into a gargantuan snake, to being banished in another dimensional space, then back to conscience. He is confused but he is used to acting fast. Seeing an area of darkness near the altar, he recited magical words to dismantle the spell and bring back the light to the area.

They all seem to be up on the other side of that railing now, and the fastest way up there seemed to be over the chasm. Flow's hand snatches the potion for flight. Feeling the tingle of the magic she lets her body float, and soar up on the other side. The darkness lifts, but her eyes are already fixed on her target, and she swirls around them with her rapier.

Don Explodicus (sfollac) — 7/10/2025 7:07 AM
As the clock ticks, Don doesn't have the time to deal with a battle against three archmages. So, he ends the matter swiftly, blasting them with a ball of acid, that engulfes all the enemies and grants an opening to Galwen for a final touch. The Fire and Cold shields are useless against these attacks. Now, only one opponent remains.

On the other side of the wall, the simulacrus considers using a polymorph spell as well to cross without damage, but then decides to try his good luck.

Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — 7/11/2025 5:53 PM
Gaermok opens his eyes, one at a time, looking around. The fire stopped, that was good. The burns hurt a lot, that was bad. But he was still standing, that was good again.

He stared for a moment at the globe in front of him. He squinted at it. He sniffed it. He tapped on it with a finger. Then he scratched his head, shrugged, and looked around for anything else to hit. He caught sight of Dan having trouble with a spirit of some sort, so Gaermok jumped down from the dais, whacked the enemy once, but then stopped. He looked over at Don and remembered their secret play.

"Don! Secret play time again?"

He leapt back up to the dais and stood ready with his greataxe to smack the enemy inside the unpoppable bubble.

*The Resilient Sphere is a powerful abjuration enchantment, capable of protecting a target against all sort of damage. It is an excellent choice in this situation, and it would give the sorceress enough time to finish her spell.

However, like most spells, it can be dispelled. Don fidgets with the words needed to disassemble and cancel the magic. It is difficult work, but the wizard is prepared, and after a few moments the sphere disappears.

The simulacrus is no more - the prismatic wall, meteor swarm, and other attacks reduced it to a smoking snowman, evaporating into the air.

Golden sands swirl around the party returning them to the entrance of the occult gate to stand before Erdegral once again.

“Thankyou defenders. It’s best you do not linger at the heart for too long, lest the stolen secrets seep into your mind.”
Gaermok Squareblock (Hunter) — Yesterday at 4:05 PM
Gaermok is about to crush the wizard in front of him, when Flow slips in and finishes her off. He shrugs and pats the tabaxi on the head.

"Good kitty. Like opposite of normal unhelpful kitty."

He slugs his axe over his shoulder and heads into the portal that leads back to Occult Gate. Tossing his bag on the floor and opening it wide enough, Gaermok drops his massive greataxe into it and ties it off tight. He waves to everyone else as he attaches it back onto his belt.

"More good defending. Nightmares about rainbows maybe. Have to find missing leprechaun next time."

Exit Gaermok
Don Explodicus (sfollac) — Yesterday at 10:33 PM
As Flow delivers the final killing blow, Don has the opportunity to observe her for a moment.

The tabaxi is a fast and furious combatant, able to sprint from one side of the battlefield to the other in a fraction of seconds. She is always running and jumping, taking on the enemies like a whirlwind of blades. Even after fighting many gates together, Don has had few opportunities to see her still for more than a few seconds. This time is different, because after the final blow, she pauses for a second. 
She destroyed that sorcerer like a thunderstorm, thinks the wizard. Just a few precise and well delivered cuts, and the enemy is defeated.

As Erdegral appears, though, there is no time to waste. Don is familiar with the dangers of the arcane prime, and he is well aware that terrible things may happen if he remains here too long. There is not even time to check whether the simulacrus is still functional or not. The meteor swarm and the other spells must have broken it, but Don is not certain. It is dangerous to leave a part of himself entrapped in a prime of arcane energy, but the wizard has to rush, and go through the portal before checking.

Exit Don
