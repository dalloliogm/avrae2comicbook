Gaermok Squareblock
Been with clan from baby time. Kid time was fun. Growed up time not always fun. Lots of bears. Lots of scars.

Lots of cold days but cold is okay. Hot is hard to do. Makes ugh feelings on skin and in head. Skin looks green but always is.

Been Tribal Warrior for long time. Real good at it for long time. But got shrunk real bad by witch clan calls Auril. Made her made and got curse of no more muscles. Had to find muscles again.

Went to clan old person. Smells funny but always does. Got thing from clan old person to drink and muscles came back. But not for good. Thought muscles for some time better than muscles for no time.

Learned how to grow big. Got real good at real big growing. But axe kept being small. Clan helped find big bigger axe. Was real good at Tribal Warrior again. But just for short times. Then stuck with no muscles for rest of time. Greatest axe hard to carry with no muscles. Clan old person had bag for holding biggest axes. No need to carry without muscles.

But thinking clan not big on no muscles time. Clan says someday there will be great honor for not having muscle. Learned someday is word for tomorrow. Learned honor is trick word for go away.

Went to clan old person again. Smells funny again but always does. Says piece of bark is magic. Go find tree bark comes from. But so many trees. Took lots of moons. Lots of wrong trees.

Right tree had empty spot for bark to go back. Bark back on tree made head stop working. Eyes and ears too. But eyes came back and saw big inside walls. Ears heard voice say welcome to Gates and thank for service. Thinking is time to learn how to do service to earn thanks.

Flow
Name: Flowing Wind of Lush Mountains (Flow)
Race (and subrace): Tabaxi
Background: Urchin Stray
Class: Swashbuckler Rogue/Battle Master Fighter

Description:
Flow is a tabaxi with a golden spotted fur. Her clothes are clean but simple; A plain blouse and a pair of pants outfitted with practical leg pockets. The armour however, look’s a bit more expensive. Noticeably high craftsmanship, well fitted and made for mobility and stealth. Her well kept rapiers follow the same pattern.

She left her home on the other side of the great sea a long time ago, at a young age, and before finding her way to the Gates she has had a rather varied life. Her first safe haven was in a rather questionable association. There she thrived, until that situation went out of hand and she decided it was best for her to leave.

She then stayed at a smaller travelling circus until she felt it was best for all involved that she they parted ways. This is when she started to earn money as an adventurer. Staying longer than she ever thought she would in a small town with an unusual amount of various problems. Her restlessness finally had her leave again, and she allowed herself to be enrolled into the armed forces of a local lord, which granted her useful battle training. This was where she heard stories about the Gates. Triggering her curiosity she left to find someone who knew how to get there.

Rhys
Name: Rhys
Race (and subrace): Shadar-Kai
Background: Sage
Class: Paladin / Wizard
Subclass: None / War

Description:
Rhys was born and raised strictly to serve the Raven Queen as her servant. He trained diligently in all manner of weaponry and fighting styles but quickly grew to favour fighting up close and personal with heavy weaponry. The training only took him so far however and he soon realized he was limited by his physicality. Rhys' mind was where his true weapon laid. Despite the path he had been placed upon by his parents, Rhys felt that fate, and the Raven Queen, had other plans for him. The study of the arcane called for him though he would not find it at home.

Rhys feared to defy his parents however and the path they set him on. Despite the fear he fled home on the night before he would have taken his Paladin Oath. Led by a raven as black as night, Rhys ran and ran until he found an isolated hermit sage. Over the next few years he was taught through study and practice magic that he never thought possible. Incantations and spells that enhanced his combat prowess. Study was not enough however and Rhys was getting antsy. He left the hermit to practice through combat what he had learned, deciding that he would learn faster in the field.

Practice he did. Rhys endured many fights and what seemed to be trials set by his raven companion. His life was nearly taken several times but death was not his fate, not yet at least. The trials by fire enhanced his capabilities beyond what he thought possible and provided him with items that complimented those abilities.

In his travels Rhys heard of The Gates, a fabled place where all manner of warriors fought to keep the forces of evil in check. He felt compelled to seek out The Gates and eventually found himself at the entrance eager to see what fate had in store for him here.

Don Explodicus
Name: Don Explodicus
Race (and subrace): Orc
Background: Far Traveler
Class: Wizard/Cleric
Subclass: Evocation/Order

Description:Explodicus is a jovial and loud orc, who likes to drink beer and blast things on the battlefield. Trained in the arts of wizardry and ordained as a cleric of Karaash, he has been sent to represent the Chiefdoms of the Roaring Lion in the defence of the Gates.

In battle he believes that the best way to motivate a bunch of uneducated and barbaric Orcs is to throw fireballs and thunder at them, and tell them that only those who have faith will be left unarmed. Sometimes one or two Orcs get accidentally incinerated, but the ones that survive find the experience very entertaining.

In terms of physical appearance, Explodicus is much weaker of the average orc, due to a deformation of his right arm that makes him unable to wield effectively most weapons. He can barely carry his Scale Mail, and at 5'6" he is short for his kind. In fact, his mission to The Gate is most likely a way to get away from some powerful enemies, as most Orc chiefs do not tolerate well Orcs that lead with smarts instead of strength.

Galwen
Name: Galwen Mannadil
Race (and subrace): Pallid Elf
Background: Custom Courtier
Class: Rogue
Subclass: Inquisitive

Description: Galwen Mannadil was 23rd in line to the Duchy of Aistaquen. Not only was she far down the line of succession, she wasn't even talented enough in their eyes. With only the barest of knowledge in their ancestral magic, she was not one that was paid attention to.

And so she focused more on things she could do without magic. Her skills, her senses, her aim. Archery. With so little attention on her, no one batted an eye when a recruiter came to their lands and asked for help Defending the Gates. And so Galwen Mannadil vowed to do so, even if it meant spilling her noble blood. The Gates were more than worth it.
